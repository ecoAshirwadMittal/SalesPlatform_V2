## 2026-04-13 — Auth token moved from localStorage to HttpOnly cookie

**Status:** Accepted — backend portion shipped (Phase 3.1 of Theme 3,
`docs/tasks/todos-resolution-plan.md`). Frontend atomic migration
(Phase 3.2) tracked separately; must ship in the same deploy window.

### Context

The frontend stored the JWT in `localStorage` and attached it via an
`Authorization: Bearer …` header. Any XSS vulnerability — including
transitive ones in third-party React components — would allow an
attacker to exfiltrate the token and impersonate the user for its full
lifetime (up to 7 days with "remember me"). `TODO(H-5)` in
`frontend/src/app/(auth)/login/LoginForm.tsx:46` flagged this.

### Decision

- **Cookie-issued JWT.** `AuthController.loginExternalUser` now returns
  a `Set-Cookie: auth_token=…; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict;
  Path=/; Max-Age=…` header on successful login. The token is no longer
  serialized in the JSON body (`LoginResponse.token` is `@JsonIgnore`d —
  kept internally as a carrier between `AuthService` and the controller).
- **TTL.** 8 hours for standard login, 24 hours when `rememberMe=true`.
  The JWT signing expiry (`app.jwt.*-expiration-ms`) is unchanged and
  remains the authoritative clock — the cookie `Max-Age` just stops the
  browser from presenting a token past the point the server would reject
  it anyway.
- **`Secure` flag is configurable.** `auth.cookie.secure` defaults to
  `false` so `http://localhost` dev works; the `production` profile and
  QA env var `AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE=true` flip it on. `HttpOnly` and
  `SameSite=Strict` are enforced in code and not configurable.
- **Filter fallback.** `JwtAuthenticationFilter` extracts the token from
  `Authorization` header first (server-to-server, tests, transitional
  clients), then from the `auth_token` cookie. Both paths feed the same
  `jwtService.isValid` + `SecurityContextHolder` pipeline.
- **Logout.** New `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` (permitAll) returns
  `204 No Content` with `Set-Cookie: auth_token=; Max-Age=0; …` to
  expire the cookie in the browser. The JWT itself is not revoked —
  without a denylist, logout is best-effort client-side.
- **CSRF stays disabled.** `SameSite=Strict` blocks cross-site form
  submissions from carrying the cookie, which is the realistic CSRF
  vector for a cookie-auth API. A full double-submit token scheme would
  add friction without meaningful risk reduction for this app's flows.

### Alternatives considered

- **Keep `localStorage` + add CSP.** Rejected: CSP reduces XSS surface
  but does not eliminate it; any inline-script escape still exposes the
  token. `HttpOnly` is a structurally stronger guarantee.
- **`SameSite=Lax`.** Considered for the eventual email-link flow (R9
  in the plan) where a GET navigation from an email client should
  arrive authed. Deferred: none of the current flows require it, and
  `Strict` is the stronger default. Revisit if marketing-link flows
  need it.
- **Revoke JWT on logout via denylist.** Rejected for Phase 1: no Redis
  in the stack yet, and the 8h/24h ceilings limit the blast radius.

### Consequences

- Frontend must stop reading/writing the token in any form —
  `apiFetch.ts` switches to `credentials: 'include'`, SSR fetches
  forward the `Cookie` header, and a ~12-file audit strips
  `localStorage.getItem('auth_token')` call sites. This work is Phase
  3.2 and must ship in the **same deploy** as the backend — half-deploys
  break login.
- Backward compatibility: the `Authorization` header path still works,
  so Postman collections, integration tests, and any lingering
  server-to-server consumer keep functioning during the transition.
- Test coverage: `AuthControllerTest` adds four new assertions
  (`login_withValidCredentials_setsHttpOnlyCookieAndOmitsTokenFromBody`,
  `login_withRememberMe_setsLongerMaxAge`, `logout_clearsCookie`,
  `me_withCookieToken_returnsUserInfo`). 15/15 green.
- Follow-ups:
  - **SSO callback cookie issuance.** `AuthController.handleSSORedirect`
    is still a pre-auth outbound redirect stub — there is no token to
    cookie yet. When the real callback lands it MUST reuse
    `buildAuthCookie(token, DEFAULT_TTL)` and attach the `Set-Cookie`
    header on the post-auth redirect. An inline `TODO(Theme 3)` now
    sits above the stub so the next SSO PR cannot miss it.
  - **Registrable-domain parity.** `SameSite=Strict` requires the
    frontend and backend in prod to share the same eTLD+1 for the
    browser to attach the cookie. Approved topologies and a
    verification checklist live in `docs/deployment/environments.md`
    under *Auth Cookie (Theme 3) → Registrable-domain parity*.
    Preferred deployment shape: reverse-proxy `/api/*` through the
    frontend origin so the question never arises.

## 2026-04-13 — PWS email delivery: post-commit event + async + feature flag

**Status:** Accepted (Theme 1 of `docs/tasks/todos-resolution-plan.md`).

### Context

Mendix parity requires four buyer-facing notifications on the PWS flow:
offer confirmation, order confirmation, pending-order (adjusted quantity),
and counter offer. The legacy Mendix microflows (`SUB_SendPWS*Email.md`)
fire synchronously inside the offer/order transaction. Porting that shape
1:1 exposes three risks:

1. **R1 — transactional coupling:** an SMTP outage would fail an offer
   submission that the DB already accepted.
2. **R3 — wrong recipients in lower envs:** dev/CI must never reach real
   buyers, and QA must be enablable independently of prod.
3. **R4 — rollback leakage:** a notification sent before the tx commits
   would be visible to customers even if the offer rolls back.

### Decision

- **Post-commit event bridge.** `OfferService` / `OfferReviewService`
  publish a sealed `PwsOfferEmailEvent` via `ApplicationEventPublisher`
  from inside the business tx. `PwsOfferEmailListener` handles each variant
  with `@TransactionalEventListener(phase = AFTER_COMMIT)` +
  `@Transactional(propagation = REQUIRES_NEW, readOnly = true)`. Rollbacks
  drop the event — no mail is sent.
- **Async executor.** The listener hands the materialized aggregate to
  `PWSEmailService`, whose send methods run on a dedicated
  `emailExecutor` (`AsyncConfig.EMAIL_EXECUTOR`) via `@Async`. Offer
  submission latency is unaffected by SMTP response time.
- **Eager fetch across async boundary.** `OfferRepository.findByIdWithItems`
  uses `LEFT JOIN FETCH o.items` so the listener's short read-only tx
  produces a fully-initialized `Offer` before the aggregate crosses
  threads — avoiding `LazyInitializationException` on the @Async worker.
- **Feature flag.** `pws.email.enabled` (default `false`) swaps
  `LoggingEmailSender` ↔ `SmtpEmailSender` via `@ConditionalOnProperty`.
  Local dev and CI log payloads only; QA and prod enable per
  `docs/deployment/environments.md`.
- **Retry + swallow.** `SmtpEmailSender.send` is
  `@Retryable(maxAttempts=3, backoff=@Backoff(delay=2000, multiplier=2))`
  on `MailException`/`MessagingException`. After the final retry,
  `PWSEmailService.safeSend` catches the exception, logs
  `PWS email delivery failed template={} offerId={} offerNumber={}`, and
  never rethrows — addressing R1.
- **Recipient resolution via native queries.**
  `EcoATMDirectUserRepository.findActiveEmailsByBuyerCodeId` and
  `findBuyerCompanyNameByBuyerCodeId` encode the Mendix recipient rules.
  The adjusted-quantity template CCs `pws.email.sales-address`.
- **Templates.** Thymeleaf HTML templates under
  `resources/templates/email/pws-*.html`, rendered with Mendix-parity
  styling tokens (`Trebuchet MS`, `#514F4E`, `#B7B5B5`, `#2CB34A`,
  `ecoATM, LLC` footer).

### Alternatives considered

- **Synchronous in-tx send (Mendix 1:1).** Rejected: couples offer
  submission availability to SMTP, and rollbacks would leak mail.
- **Outbox table + poller.** Heavier than needed for Phase 1 and
  duplicates work that Theme 2 (`integration.snowflake_sync_log`) will
  introduce for a different purpose. Revisit if a retry budget / DLQ is
  required — see "No DLQ yet" in `environments.md`.
- **Spring `ApplicationEventPublisher` without `AFTER_COMMIT`.** Rejected:
  default sync listeners fire before commit, re-introducing R4.

### Consequences

- Offer submission latency is bounded by DB commit, not SMTP.
- An SMTP outage drops notifications silently after 3 retries; there is
  no dead-letter queue in Phase 1. Monitoring must watch the
  `PWS email delivery failed` log line.
- Enabling prod delivery is a config-only change (`PWS_EMAIL_ENABLED=true`
  + SMTP env vars) with no redeploy — see
  `docs/deployment/environments.md`.
- Test coverage: 6 unit tests (`PWSEmailServiceTest`) mock the template
  engine and sender to assert recipient branching and failure-swallowing;
  1 end-to-end test (`PWSEmailServiceIT`) wires a real `TemplateEngine` +
  `SmtpEmailSender` → GreenMail on `ServerSetupTest.SMTP` and asserts
  Mendix-parity markers in the rendered body.
